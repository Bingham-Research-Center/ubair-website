## Initial Purpose

The original easter eggs (Dutch John Rick Roll, Emma Park Road, Welsh Mode, and Chemtrails) were created for:

1. **Testing Functionality** - Quick way to test interactive features, event handlers, and DOM manipulation
2. **Team Morale** - Lighthearted content during development to keep the team engaged
3. **Placeholder Content** - Demonstrating UI patterns that could be used for real features later

These original easter eggs have been moved into a consolidated "storage" system and are now activated via the Konami code rather than being visible by default.

---

## How to Activate

### Easter Eggs - Konami Code Sequence
Easter eggs are activated by entering the classic Konami code:

```
‚Üë ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üí B A
```

**On Desktop:**
- Use arrow keys for directional inputs
- Press the `B` key
- Press the `A` key

**Result:**
When the correct sequence is entered, you'll see a "üéâ Easter Eggs Activated! üéâ" message, and easter eggs will appear on their respective pages.

To deactivate, simply enter the Konami code again.

---

### Kiosk Mode - Secret Keyword
Kiosk mode (full-screen display mode) is accessed by typing a secret keyword:

**How to Activate:**
1. Type `lawsondavies` anywhere on the site (case-insensitive)
2. You'll see a "üîß Opening Kiosk Mode" message
3. Kiosk mode opens in a new tab

**Result:**
- Opens `/kiosk` page in a new browser tab
- Full-screen air quality display mode
- Automatically cycles through monitoring stations
- Perfect for public displays, presentations, or demonstrations

---

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

```
/public/js/easter-eggs.js       # All easter egg logic
/public/css/easter-eggs.css     # All easter egg styles
```

### Architecture

The easter egg system uses an object-oriented approach with a single `EasterEggManager` class:

```javascript
class EasterEggManager {
    - Listens for Konami code input
    - Toggles easter eggs on/off
    - Injects page-specific easter eggs
    - Manages state and cleanup
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Initialization:** `EasterEggManager` is instantiated on page load
2. **Keyboard Listener:** Tracks last 10 keypresses, checks for Konami sequence
3. **Activation:** When sequence matches, determines current page and injects appropriate easter eggs
4. **Deactivation:** Removes all easter egg DOM elements and restores original state

### Integration

Easter eggs are loaded on every page via:

```html
<!-- Easter Eggs - Activated via Konami Code -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/public/css/easter-eggs.css">
<script src="/public/js/easter-eggs.js"></script>
```

The system automatically detects which page is loaded and activates the correct easter eggs.

---

## How to Add New Easter Eggs

### Step 1: Add Activation Method

In `/public/js/easter-eggs.js`, add a new method to the `EasterEggManager` class:

```javascript
/**
 * Your Easter Egg Name
 */
activateYourEasterEgg() {
    const easterEggHTML = `
        <div class="easter-egg-box your-egg-class" id="your-egg-id">
            <!-- Your HTML structure -->
        </div>
    `;

    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', easterEggHTML);

    // Add event listeners
    const yourButton = document.getElementById('your-button-id');
    yourButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Your easter egg behavior
    });
}
```

### Step 2: Register Page Route

In the `activateEasterEggs()` method, add your page route:

```javascript
activateEasterEggs() {
    const path = window.location.pathname;

    if (path === '/' || path === '/index.html') {
        this.activateDutchJohnEasterEgg();
    } else if (path.includes('your-page-name')) {
        this.activateYourEasterEgg(); // Add this line
    }
    // ... other routes
}
```

### Step 3: Add Styles

In `/public/css/easter-eggs.css`, add your styles:

```css
/* Your Easter Egg Name */
.your-egg-class {
    position: fixed;
    /* Your styling */
}
```

### Step 4: Test

1. Navigate to your page
2. Enter Konami code: ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí‚Üê‚ÜíBA
3. Verify easter egg appears and functions correctly
4. Enter Konami code again to verify it deactivates cleanly

## Future Ideas

### Educational Content

Easter eggs can serve educational purposes while being fun:

- **Air Quality Facts**: Click a hidden element to reveal interesting ozone chemistry facts
- **Basin History**: Historical photos and stories about the Uintah Basin region
- **Weather Trivia**: Fun meteorological facts specific to the Basin's unique geography
- **Data Science Insights**: Behind-the-scenes look at how forecasting models work
- **Wildlife & Environment**: Information about how air quality affects local ecosystems

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
activateAirQualityFactsEgg() {
    // Shows random air quality fact when activated
    const facts = [
        "Ground-level ozone forms when NOx and VOCs react in sunlight",
        "The Uintah Basin's topography creates ideal conditions for winter inversions",
        "Ozone levels are typically lowest in early morning and highest in afternoon"
    ];
    // Display random fact with nice animation
}
```

### Team Celebration Triggers

### Implementation Example

```javascript
// In EasterEggManager constructor
checkSpecialOccasions() {
    const today = new Date();
    const month = today.getMonth() + 1;
    const day = today.getDate();

    // St. David's Day (Welsh holiday)
    if (month === 3 && day === 1) {
        this.autoActivateWelshMode = true;
    }

    // Earth Day
    if (month === 4 && day === 22) {
        this.activateEarthDayEgg();
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Guidelines for New Easter Eggs

1. **Keep it Professional**: Easter eggs should be fun but not detract from the site's credibility
2. **Educational Value**: Prioritize easter eggs that teach users something interesting
3. **Performance**: Don't slow down page load times
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure easter eggs are keyboard-accessible
5. **Cleanup**: Always properly remove easter eggs when deactivated
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Test on mobile devices (Konami code works with on-screen arrow keys)
7. **No Breaking Changes**: Easter eggs should never interfere with core functionality

### Content Guidelines

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Educational air quality and weather facts
