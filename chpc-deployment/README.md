## Quick Start

**For first-time deployment (30 minutes):**

1. **Copy to CHPC:**
   ```bash
   scp -r chpc-deployment/ username@chpc.utah.edu:~/
   ```

2. **Run setup:**
   ```bash
   ssh username@chpc.utah.edu
   cd ~/chpc-deployment
   bash setup_chpc_env.sh
   ```

3. **Test:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   bash test_upload.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   crontab cron_templates/crontab_observations_only.txt
   ```

5. **Monitor:**
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/logs/basinwx/observations.log
   ```

**For detailed instructions, see:** `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## What This Package Does

This deployment package automates the transfer of weather observation data from CHPC compute servers to the BasinWx website (basinwx.com).

**Data Flow:**
```
CHPC (brc-tools)  →  HTTPS POST  →  basinwx.com (Node.js server)
   |                                      |
   |                                      ↓
   ├─ Generate observations         Store in public/api/static/
   ├─ Generate metadata
   ├─ Validate against manifest
   └─ Upload via API

Cron Job (every 10 min)            Website displays on live map
```

**What Gets Deployed:**
- Environment configuration (API keys, URLs)
- Automated cron jobs for data uploads
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Testing and diagnostic tools

---

## Prerequisites

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

**CHPC Side:**
- `brc-tools` Python package
- `get_map_obs.py` - Data generation script
- `push_data.py` - Upload script
- Cron jobs for automation
- Log files in `~/logs/basinwx/`

**Website Side:**
- Node.js/Express server
- `/api/upload/:dataType` endpoint
- Data validation against `DATA_MANIFEST.json`
- Storage in `public/api/static/`
- Monitoring APIs

**Data Types:**
| Type | Frequency | Size | Priority |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| observations | Every 10 min | ~40KB | HIGH |
| metadata | Every 6 hours | ~8KB | MEDIUM |
| timeseries | Hourly | Varies | MEDIUM |
| outlooks | Twice daily | ~5KB | LOW |
| images | Every 30 min | ~500KB | LOW |

## Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables (CHPC)

```bash
# Required
export DATA_UPLOAD_API_KEY="48cd2f722c19af756e7443230efe9fcc"
export BASINWX_API_URL="https://basinwx.com"
```

**⚠️ Note:** Use `DATA_UPLOAD_API_KEY` (not `BASINWX_API_KEY`) to match brc-tools code.

### Configuration Files (CHPC)

```
~/.config/ubair-website/website_url     # Contains: https://basinwx.com
```

### Cron Schedule

**Minimal (testing):**
```cron
*/10 * * * * source ~/.bashrc && cd ~/brc-tools && python3 brc_tools/download/get_map_obs.py >> ~/logs/basinwx/observations.log 2>&1
```

**Full Production:**
- See `cron_templates/crontab_full.txt`

---

## Verification

After deployment, verify:

### 1. Manual Upload Works
```bash
cd ~/brc-tools
python3 brc_tools/download/get_map_obs.py
# Should show: "✅ Successfully uploaded"
```

### 2. Data Appears on Website
```bash
curl https://basinwx.com/api/filelist.json
# Should list recent files
```

### 3. Cron Runs Successfully
```bash
# Wait 10 minutes after installing cron
tail -50 ~/logs/basinwx/observations.log
# Should show recent successful upload
```

### 4. Monitoring Shows Healthy
```bash
curl https://basinwx.com/api/monitoring/freshness
# observations status should be "fresh"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

| Symptom | Quick Fix | Full Details |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| "API key not set" | `source ~/.bashrc` | DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, Step 3 |
| "Upload failed (401)" | Check API key matches | BRC_TOOLS_REVIEW.md, Issue #1 |
| "Cron not running" | Verify crontab: `crontab -l` | MONITORING_GUIDE.md |
| "Data stale" | Check logs: `tail ~/logs/basinwx/*.log` | MONITORING_GUIDE.md |

**Diagnostic Tools:**

```bash
# Comprehensive test
bash ~/chpc-deployment/test_upload.sh

# Health check only
bash ~/chpc-deployment/test_upload.sh --health-only

# Validation only (no upload)
bash ~/chpc-deployment/test_upload.sh --validate-only
```

---

## Important Notes

### API Key Configuration
⚠️ The brc-tools code expects `DATA_UPLOAD_API_KEY` (not `BASINWX_API_KEY`).
All scripts in this package use the correct variable name.

See `BRC_TOOLS_REVIEW.md` for detailed explanation.

### Working Directory
⚠️ Scripts use relative path `../../data/` for output.
Cron jobs MUST include `cd ~/brc-tools` before running scripts.

All cron templates handle this correctly.

### Monitoring Route Not Registered
⚠️ Website has monitoring code but routes not registered in server.js.
Monitoring endpoints may need to be activated on website side.

See website documentation for activation steps.

### Station CLN Missing Data
⚠️ Station CLN missing `wind_direction` and `wind_speed`.
This is a known issue and doesn't block uploads (warning only).

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

✅ Manual upload completes without errors
✅ Cron jobs installed and visible in `crontab -l`
✅ Logs show successful uploads every 10 minutes
✅ Website shows data < 10 minutes old
✅ No errors in last 24 hours of logs
✅ Monitoring shows "healthy" status

---

1. Follow `ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md`
2. Stop cron: `crontab -r`
3. Document and escalate
