# Uintah Basin Winter Ozone forecast outlook
### **Two-Week Overview**: potential for season's first ozone event emerging
Issued: 2.30pm Mountain Time, 30 December 2024

### Day 1–5 (Mon 30 Dec–Fri 3 Jan):
NO RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
HIGH CONFIDENCE
Current conditions show insufficient snow cover across most of the Basin to support elevated ozone formation. While temperatures have been cold enough to establish inversions (with temperature differences of up to 15°F between valley floors and surrounding higher elevations), the lack of persistent snow cover prevents significant photochemical ozone production. A weak weather system is expected to pass through on Wednesday (Day 3), but precipitation amounts will likely be minimal at Basin level and insufficient to establish the necessary snow cover.

### Day 6–10 (Sat 4 Jan–Wed 8 Jan):
MODERATE RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
MODERATE CONFIDENCE
The forecast models show increasing potential for a significant winter storm system around Days 6-7 (Saturday-Sunday). This system has potential to deposit 3-6 inches of snow across the Basin, with higher amounts at elevated locations. If this snowfall materializes, it would be followed by a building high pressure system that would establish favorable conditions for ozone formation. The key uncertainty in this period is the exact track and intensity of the storm system, with some model solutions showing a more northerly track that would reduce snowfall in the Basin to 1-2 inches, which would be insufficient for significant ozone development.

Our confidence increases through this period as the potential for stable atmospheric conditions strengthens. By Day 9-10 (Tuesday-Wednesday), if 3+ inches of snow has fallen and persists, we could see the beginning of ozone accumulation in the 45-65 ppb range.

### Day 11–15 (Thu 9 Jan–Mon 13 Jan):
HIGH RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
LOW CONFIDENCE
Long-range forecasts suggest the high pressure system will strengthen and persist through this period, potentially creating ideal conditions for the season's first significant ozone event. If the snow from the Day 6-7 storm remains in place, and if predicted clear skies and light winds verify, ozone concentrations could reach levels of potential concern (>70 ppb) by Day 12-13 (Friday-Saturday). The confidence in this scenario is low due to the extended forecast period and the conditional nature of the forecast (dependent on prior snowfall). 

Alternative scenarios include:
1. Insufficient initial snow cover leading to minimal ozone production
2. Earlier breakdown of the high pressure pattern around Day 11-12, limiting the duration of any ozone buildup
3. Another storm system bringing additional snow but also increased mixing that would temporarily disrupt ozone accumulation

We will closely monitor the evolution of this potential first seasonal event and provide updates as confidence increases.

# Extended discussion
The 2024-2025 winter ozone season has been slow to start due to limited snow cover across the Basin. This matches our earlier seasonal outlook which predicted a later onset to ozone season compared to historical averages. The upcoming pattern change represents the first significant potential for winter ozone formation this season.

Our new AI-based prediction system, Clyfar, shows interesting results for this potential event. When provided with the ensemble of weather forecasts, Clyfar indicates that approximately 30% of scenarios result in ozone exceeding health-based standards during Days 11-15, with the remaining 70% showing elevated but not concerning levels. This probabilistic approach helps quantify the uncertainty in our forecast.

A unique aspect of early-season events is the potential influence of holiday activities. The New Year period typically sees increased emissions from traffic and other sources, which could enhance ozone formation if meteorological conditions are favorable. These emissions would be most concentrated near population centers, potentially creating localized "hot spots" of elevated ozone.

For interested stakeholders, we've prepared a special research brief on our website examining the relationship between early-season ozone events and seasonal patterns. Historical analysis suggests that years with January ozone events often (but not always) develop into active ozone seasons, particularly if the snow cover established in early events persists through subsequent weeks.
