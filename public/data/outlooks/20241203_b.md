# EXAMPLE FOR TESTING! FAKE DAY 3 update 

**Current Conditions:**
Pressure is dropping quickly over the Uintah Basin, so we have a second update today so lower the risk of an inversion and ozone formation. The PM2.5 concentration in Vernal is 20 µg/m³, and the PM2.5 concentration in Roosevelt is 25 µg/m³. No inversion expected.

**Outlook:**
The inversion is expected to break early next week, with a storm system moving into the area. This storm system will bring snow to the basin, which will help to clear out the pollution.

**Air Quality Alerts:**
No air quality alerts are in effect for the Uintah Basin.

**Health Effects:**
PM2.5 concentrations are moderate in Vernal and Roosevelt. People with heart or lung disease, children, and older adults should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.
