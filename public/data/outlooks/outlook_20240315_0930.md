# Uintah Basin Winter Ozone forecast outlook
### **Two-Week Overview**: Closing winter season with minimal ozone risk
Issued: 9.30am Mountain Time, 15 March 2025

### Day 1–5 (Sat 15 Mar–Wed 19 Mar):
LOW RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
HIGH CONFIDENCE
A warming trend continues with daytime temperatures reaching into the mid 40s °F. Snow cover is minimal across most of the Basin, with only patchy areas in higher elevations and shaded valleys. The combination of limited snow cover and relatively warm temperatures will prevent any significant ozone formation. There is a small system approaching on Tuesday (Day 4) that may bring some light precipitation, but temperatures will remain too warm for significant snow accumulation at Basin level.

### Day 6–10 (Thu 20 Mar–Mon 24 Mar):
NO RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
HIGH CONFIDENCE
Springlike conditions will become firmly established through this period. Daytime temperatures will consistently reach into the 50s °F with overnight lows generally above freezing. Any remaining snow patches will continue to melt rapidly. Models show good agreement on a more active pattern with increased wind speed and mixing, which will further inhibit any potential for inversions or ozone buildup.

### Day 11–15 (Tue 25 Mar–Sat 29 Mar):
NO RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
As we move toward the end of March, wintertime ozone conditions become increasingly unlikely. This pattern of warmer temperatures and better atmospheric mixing is expected to continue, with no risk factors for elevated ozone identified during this period. This will likely be among our final winter ozone outlooks for the 2024-2025 season, as we transition into spring conditions.

# Extended discussion
The 2024-2025 winter season is drawing to a close with minimal ozone concerns. This winter saw fewer high-ozone episodes than the previous season, largely due to the inconsistent snowpack and frequent storm systems that prevented lengthy inversions from establishing. 

Looking back at this season, we observed three significant ozone events:
1. Late January (24-30): Moderate to high ozone following the substantial snowfall on January 22-23
2. Early February (7-11): Brief moderate ozone episode during a short-lived cold pool
3. Late February (20-26): The most significant event of the season, with ozone levels exceeding health standards for several consecutive days

Our forecast accuracy has improved this season, with particularly good performance in identifying the onset of high-ozone conditions. The Clyfar AI model showed promising results in predicting not just the occurrence but also the magnitude of ozone events when provided with accurate meteorological forecasts. Areas for continued improvement include better prediction of cold pool breakdown and snow melt rates, which remain challenging variables.

The season summary report with detailed analysis will be published in April, comparing observed conditions with forecasts and evaluating the performance of our prediction tools.
