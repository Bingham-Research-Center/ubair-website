# Uintah Basin Winter Ozone forecast outlook
### **Two-Week Overview**: Significant ozone potential with upcoming snow and stable conditions
Issued: 11.15am Mountain Time, 5 February 2025

### Day 1–5 (Wed 5 Feb–Sun 9 Feb):
HIGH RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
HIGH CONFIDENCE
Current conditions strongly support continued ozone formation. The snow cover from last weekend's 5-inch accumulation remains intact across most of the Basin, with excellent albedo (reflectivity) enhancing the photochemical reactions. Temperatures show a persistent inversion with daytime highs barely reaching 25°F at Basin level. Little atmospheric mixing is expected through Friday. Saturday (Day 4) brings slight warming but still below freezing temperatures. We observed ozone levels above 70 ppb yesterday at multiple monitoring stations, and expect these levels to persist or increase through Day 3 (Friday), with possible slight decreases during the weekend as temperatures moderate.

### Day 6–10 (Mon 10 Feb–Fri 14 Feb):
MODERATE RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
MODERATE CONFIDENCE
A transition period begins with uncertainty in forecast models. Two competing scenarios emerge:

1. **Continued cold scenario (40% probability)**: Temperatures remain below freezing with minimal mixing, allowing the current high-ozone event to continue, though gradually diminishing as snow ages
2. **Warming scenario (60% probability)**: Temperatures rise above freezing by mid-week with increased atmospheric mixing, effectively ending the current ozone event

Model disagreement grows through this period with significant temperature spread. We lean toward the warming scenario but acknowledge significant uncertainty, especially in the timing of any warm-up. The Clyfar model predicts ozone levels will begin to decrease by Wednesday (Day 8) regardless of scenario, as emissions from the snow surface begin to diminish and transport processes increase.

### Day 11–15 (Sat 15 Feb–Wed 19 Feb):
LOW RISK OF ELEVATED OZONE
LOW CONFIDENCE
Long-range forecasts suggest a pattern change bringing more active weather by Day 11-12. There's approximately 70% probability for a storm system to affect the Basin during this period. This would effectively end any ongoing high-ozone conditions by increasing atmospheric mixing. However, confidence decreases substantially this far out, and we cannot rule out another snow event followed by high pressure, which would reset conditions favorable for ozone formation.

# Extended discussion
The current ozone event demonstrates classic characteristics of winter ozone in the Uintah Basin. The recent snowfall provided an excellent reflective surface and cold, stable air accumulated quickly afterward. Unlike the late January event, which saw rapid snowmelt at the edges of the Basin, this event has maintained more uniform snow cover.

Our networked monitoring stations show ozone building at different rates across the Basin. The highest concentrations are currently in the Roosevelt-Myton corridor (peaking at 82 ppb yesterday), with somewhat lower values around Vernal (68 ppb) and the northern edges (54-62 ppb). This spatial variability aligns with both the snow depth variations and the likely distribution of precursor emissions.

The Clyfar AI model output below presents a probabilistic forecast of ozone concentrations over time. The heatmap indicates the likelihood of different ozone levels at Basin-representative locations, with warmer colors showing higher probability. The dark red band from Days 1-5 indicates high confidence in elevated ozone during this period. The gradual diffusion of colors after Day 5 represents the increasing uncertainty in our forecast, with multiple potential outcomes becoming more equally likely.

Current conditions represent the most significant ozone event of the 2024-2025 winter season to date. We recommend implementing voluntary emission reduction strategies through at least Friday (Day 3), with updates to follow as the forecast evolves.
