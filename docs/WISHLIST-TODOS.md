# Wishlist and TODOs

- Verification page (how well are weather models and Clyfar doing?)
- LLM interpretations of weather data 
- Interactive LLM mini-bots for interacting with interpretation
- More plane data, including derived vertical profiles? 
- More info about the science via short videos, FAQs, the jrl.ac blog, and the original papers.
